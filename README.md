# Amazon Project

The Marketing Department wants a better understanding of its customers, specifically around improving their targeted email marketing campaigns.

They are looking to you to generate the following recommendations:
-What time of day, day of week, or day of month should marketing emails be sent out for different categories of products
-Are there any types of products that deserve special attention?
-How do we influence our top customers to spend more?

The focus is on the UK customers only
